ML model is on a jupyter notebook file called `border_crossing_model.ipynb`. Once the model is trained a pickle file is created called `border_crossing_model.pkl`. The model is then loaded in the `app.py` file and used to predict the next 2 year's border crossing data. Streamlit application is runable locally by running the command `streamlit run prediction_app.py` in the terminal.
